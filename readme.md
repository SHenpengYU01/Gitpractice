# read me

## why started it

because I want to learn more about the github,which is a very important plantform for all the necessary users,and I hope someday I can contribute to it myself instead of taking all the time .  

## what will I do

in the last few days of my winter holiday , I want to practise some basic things about the git and github and get familiar with the pr normals.
